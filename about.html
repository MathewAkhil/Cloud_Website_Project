            <div class="describeMe">
                <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M</a> class of 2024 pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics. 
                    I have interests in machine learning and software development. I am part of the 
                    <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/eh/index.html">Engineering Honors Program</a> at the university 
                    and I am a part of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thrive_saiv/?hl=en">Thrive SAIV</a>.</p><br>

                <p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kattappana">Kattappana, India</a> and lived there for a couple 
                    of years before moving with my parents to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman">Oman</a>. I would stay 
                    there for the next four years before moving to the United States. When I first came to America, I lived in 
                    <a href="https://www.durhamnc.gov">Durham, North Carolina</a>. I would continue this pattern of moving around after a couple of years of staying in the 
                    same place, going wherever my parents job led us to. All this moving around made me a really social person as I 
                    had to acquire the ability to make friends quickly. In 2011, I moved to Fort Worth, Texas and stayed there for 
                    the remainder of elementary school before moving to Lewisville, Texas, which is where I would remain until 
                    college.</p><br>

                <p>I was not introduced to computer programming until my freshman year of high school at 
                    <a href="https://www.lisd.net/hhs">Hebron High School</a>. I initially was hesitant to 
                    take that course but my dad was able to convince me to try it out. Little did I know, that small decision 
                    would set me on the path to my current career. Taking that class ignited a flame within me that I had never 
                    felt before. I can honestly say that I fell in love with computer programming because of that class. We 
                    learned everything in Java for this class and while it was tough to learn a new language, it was a challenge 
                    I enjoyed completing. Eventually I would go on to take AP Computer Science, which further solidified my interest 
                    in the field of computer science.</p><br>

                <p>When it was time to look for colleges, I searched everywhere to find a good engineering school with an 
                    outstanding computer science department. In my search, I happened to stumble upon Texas A&M. They had a very 
                    prestigious engineering school with an amazing computer science department as well as outstanding faculty. 
                    I decided to take a campus tour and after seeing everything with my own eyes, I knew that Texas A&M was 
                    the school for me.</p><br>
